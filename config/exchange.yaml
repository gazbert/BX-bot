# Exchange Adapter YAML config.
#
# - All fields are mandatory unless stated otherwise.
# - BX-bot only supports running 1 exchange per bot.
# - Sample config below is using the Test Exchange Adapter - it only makes public API calls to Bitstamp.
# - The indentation levels are significant in YAML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
#
# See the README "How do I write my own Exchange Adapter?" section for more details.

exchange:

  # A friendly name for the Exchange. Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed.
  name: Test Bitstamp Exchange

  # For the adapter value, you must specify the fully qualified name of your Exchange Adapter class so the Trading Engine
  # can load and execute it. The class must be on the runtime classpath.
  adapter: com.gazbert.bxbot.exchanges.TryModeExchangeAdapter

  authenticationConfig:
    # Add your Bitstamp trading API credentials here. See https://www.bitstamp.net/api/ - API Authentication.
    client-id: your-client-id
    key: your-api-key
    secret: your-secret-key

  networkConfig:
    # This value is in SECONDS. It is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket connect/socket read
    # when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached, the exchange adapter will give up and
    # throw a Trading API TimeoutException.
    #
    # The exchange adapter is single threaded: if one request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent requests from
    # getting to the exchange. This timeout prevents an indefinite block.
    #
    # You'll need to experiment with values here.
    connectionTimeout: 30

    # Optional HTTP status codes that will trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal ExchangeNetworkException
    # if the exchange returns any of the below in an API call response:
    nonFatalErrorCodes: [502, 503, 504, 520, 522, 525]

    # Optional java.io exception messages that will trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal ExchangeNetworkException
    # if the exchange returns any of the below in an API call response:
    nonFatalErrorMessages:
      - Connection reset
      - Connection refused
      - Remote host closed connection during handshake
      - Unexpected end of file from server

  # Other config for adapter - it's not needed for Bitstamp and otherConfig could be omitted.
  # (Included here to show example usage).
  otherConfig:
    # the counter currency which is simulated. This must fit to your used markets counter currency
    simulatedCounterCurrency: USD

    # the starting balance for the simulation. The simulation starts with this amount as counter currency
    counterCurrencyStartingBalance: 100

    # the base currency which is simulated. This must fit to your used markets base currency
    simulatedBaseCurrency: BTC

    # the starting balance for the simulation. The simulation starts with this amount as base currency
    baseCurrencyStartingBalance: 2

    # the adapter which should be used for public API calls. All special config values for this adapter must be given in this other config section as well
